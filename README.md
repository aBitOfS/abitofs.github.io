## [Sudoku](https://abitofs.github.io/sudokuSolve)

My first complete app with lots of functions:
- Sudoku solving
- Comfortable environment for solving on your own
- Generating tables
In the future I consider adding:
- Different sizes/types of tables - now only standard 9x9
- Better look on mobile devices - this version don't have compatibility with them
- Ability to generate more tables at one time
